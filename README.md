# DockerLens

DockerLens is a tool for managing and monitoring Docker containers on your Docker host. It’s designed for those who rely on Docker or Docker Compose to run home lab projects and want a streamlined interface to oversee container performance and system usage.

With DockerLens, you will be able to:

- **View Containers:** See all running containers and monitor their resource usage.
- **Manage Images:** Browse and organize Docker images on your host.
- **Get System Overviews:** Access high-level insights into Docker’s overall resource usage.

**NOTE: Still under development, so some of these features are still to be implemented.**
